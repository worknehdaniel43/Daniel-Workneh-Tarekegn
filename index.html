<h1>Ethiopian Culture: Traditions, Food, and Dance</h1>

<p>
Ethiopian culture is rich, colorful, and full of history. From traditional clothing to delicious foods and lively dances, Ethiopia offers unique experiences. The people wear beautiful hand-woven dresses called Habesha Kemis and celebrate with joyful music and movement. Ethiopian cuisine includes spicy stews, fresh vegetables, and injera—a soft, sour flatbread. Coffee ceremonies are an important social event, bringing family and friends together. Dancing, especially during festivals, shows Ethiopia’s vibrant spirit. Whether through clothing, food, or dance, Ethiopian culture connects people and tells stories passed down for generations.
